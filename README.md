# Log_Euclidean_Riemannian_Subspace_Learning
This code is for the single object tracking of our PAMI paper, Single and Multiple Object Tracking Using Log-Euclidean Riemannian Subspace and Block-Division Appearance Model.

The code is based on David Rossâ€™ matlab code for object tracking by incremental learning. There are some mexw32/mexw64 format files, which are compiled in my PC. If they do not work in your PC, you should install C or C++ compilers in your matlab and compile the C files dependently in your PC to get your mexw32/mexw64 format files. For details, please see <a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/mex.html">here</a>. Then you can run it after customizing your file paths.

I hope the code can help to understand our paper. Questions regarding the code may be directed to Prof. Xi Li (xilizju AT zju.edu.cn) or me (whluo.china AT gmail.com). Your help is highly appreciated.
